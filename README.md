The main repository (both containing `blockchain-nodes` and `web`) of the thesis named as "Design of a Credential Verification System using Blockchain Technology".

## Notice

I would like to work on some several parts of this project, but I do not wish to re=invent their wheels. **This project is under low-priority**. But will try to keep it updated in terms of information about what I did here.

## TODO

* Full documentation of this `README`
* Data Scraping to Github Render of the latest data dumped after the **Final Defense**
* Link to Documentation and Video for Demo
* Demonstration for Various Case (_Mostly on Features_)
* Resources or Links obtained from the Private Discord Server
* Logo Linking generated by one of the members of the group

## Rejected Tasks / CANNOT DO

This section contains a set of features/task that **I will not do** for the sake of my sanity.

* Blockchain Techniques — While we do agree that what I did here is purely **opinionated**, I do not really recommend or extend of what I have done. Picking an existing tech and not trying it is a serious mistake, to which have led to me, **starting from the scratch** when the intended outcome could have been integrating the credentials from an existing blockchain tech. It's really hard to grasp of what I did here, even with provided materials, but I just do wish that what I did here is not-exactly right but good enough to represent how blockchain works.
* Docker Containers to Cluster / Kubernetes — I could have made it more than just docker containers, but I can't do any further as my system is fairly limited. But even when I have a better equipment, I do not qualify this project as a test bed or for experimentation but rather a conceptualized test case could be possible here.
* SQL Backend Renewal Statements to One-Liner Statement — As much as I want to renew it for the sake of learning `SQLAlchemy` more and wanted to make things clearer, I cannot test these functionality under very specific use case. Even though its attainable to reproduce to hit a certain function, it's extremely hard to debug it due to the suffering of my laptop as the nodes are running at the same time.
## Information
* Website Renewal — **I did not start** the web app of this project, its someone else; but I DID co-authored it and adjusted it based to my standards in bare-minimum case.


## Information

Video (Demo): ???
Documentation: ???
Flowcharts: ???

> The reason why I cannot give them yet is because I haven't moved all of my academic files to my local storage. And as far as I know, I have to move them because there's a storage limit space so I need to have my own account to store this one, which I did not yet plan. 

## Technicality

This section contains all the techniques or the technicality of the project and how I managed to make it this part; technical-wise.

### Mechanics

#### Opinionated Technique of Developing the Blockchain System

> REMEMBER: Site-knowledged.

### Tech Stacks

#### `Node (Backend)`

TODO.

#### `Web`

TODO.

#### How did I make it work?

TODO.

## Further Information

## FAQ

This section contains questions that did not frequently asked but is most-likely to be asked.

1. Why?
  > I did not wish for this project. [ ... ]

2. ???
  > This is the *only project that **almost made me eliminate myself** from the world of full of incompentence*, this was with the context of other people trying to the bare-minimum considered, so this means that no one was except me.

3. ???
  > I would rather work on something else and repeat as a 4th year, but due to some controversial issue/s, I did not wish to speak about it.

4. What are other tech stack you considered?
  > BigchainDB and Sawtooth. The only reason I did not use them was because of [1] Lack of documentation, [2] No demo for me to play with, such that they are shown by chunks, [3] I have no time, since my first approach was to create the system from the **scratch** due to potential system incompatibility upon extensibility of other features that I need.
  
> If you have further questions, let me know.

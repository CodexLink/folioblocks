Node Component, Dashboard API

This section contains API endpoints for the dashboard. Dashboard API is only available on Node API with a role of Master Node. As a developer, I do understand the consequences of a node running 3 set of APIs, but to cut costs, I need to deploy it this way. In ideal world, this is not acceptable.

Logger â€” A customized logger that makes the uvicorn logger and the top-level logger co-exist from one another.
The logging for both may be seperate but their formatting should be consistent.

        A class method that modifies some of the properties of the uvicorn.config.LOGGING_CONFIG to allow colorized-output on the console while saving the output with the stripped colored in a log file.

        Args:
            base_config (dict[str, Any]): The dictionary that contains logging properties. It should contain uvicorn.config.LOGGING_CONFIG.
            disable_file_logging (bool, optional): Disables logging to the file. Defaults to False.

        Returns:
            dict[str, Any]: A modified base_config (uvicorn.logging.LOGGING_CONFIG)

        Note:
            The logging configuration by uvicorn seems to be hard to modify for a casual `logging module` enjoyer. I never knew it would take me 7-8 hours knowing where to configure and the amount of time of consideration of implementing features for my logger.

            The configuration right here is an inline file-based configuration. Inlined in a sense that I may be modifying the configuration by JSON but we are doing it inside of python instance. Note that I didn't use any python bindings or imports to comform with the typical configuration. The reason is that, since uvicorn accepts `log_config`, I might as well invoke / inject configuration so that when it was passed, it will be applied once and there will be no additional bs that I may encounter as it may emit unintended results.

            Please refer to the uvicorn logging configuration to understand how I override some of these attributes that is already configured. And please refer to the logging module as well for the formatting and other such.

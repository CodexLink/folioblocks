@o The following are required: `JWT Token`, `Source Address`, and `Auth Code` (as Auth Acceptance Code)

- When the `MASTER_NODE` identified those tokens to be valid, it will create a special token for the association.
- To-reiterate, the following are the structure of the token that is composed of the attributes between the communicator `ARCHIVAL_MINER_NODE` and the `MASTER_NODE`.
- Which will be the result of the entity named as `AssociationCertificate`.

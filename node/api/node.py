@o However, since we already did some established connection between them, we need to pass them off from the `ARCHIVAL_MINER_NODE`s themselves to the

# Node-to-Node Establish Connection Endpoints

@o Before doing anything, an `ARCHIVAL_MINER_NODE` has to establish connection to the `MASTER_NODE`.
@o With that, the `ARCHIVAL_MINER_NODE` has to give something a proof, that shows their proof of registration and login.
@o The following are required: `JWT Token` and `Auth Code` (as Auth Acceptance Code)

- When the `MASTER_NODE` identified those tokens to be valid, it will create a special token for the association.
- To-reiterate, the following are the structure of the token that is composed of the attributes between the communicator `ARCHIVAL_MINER_NODE` and the `MASTER_NODE`.
- Which will be the result of the entity named as `AssociationCertificate`.

@o From the `ARCHIVAL_MINER_NODE`: (See above).
@o From the `MASTER_NODE`: `ARCHIVAL_MINER_NODE`'s keys + AUTH_KEY (1st-Half, 32 characters) + SECRET_KEY(2nd-half, 32 character offset, 64 characters)

# Result: AssociationCertificate for the `ARCHIVAL_MINER_NODE` in AES form, whereas, the key is based from the SECRET_KEY + AUTH_KEY + DATETIME (in ISO format).

! Note that the result from the `MASTER_NODE` is saved, thurs, using `datetime` for the final key is possible.

- When this was created, `ARCHIVAL_MINER_NODE` will save this under the database and will be used further with no expiration.

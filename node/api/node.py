/consensus/negotiate | This is gonna be complex, on MASTER, if there's current negotiation then create a new one (token). Then return a consensus as initial from the computation of the consensus_timer.
/consensus/negotiate | When there's already a negotiation, when called by MASTER, return the context of the consensus_timer and other properties that validates you of getting the block when you are selected.
/consensus/negotiate | When block was fetched then acknowledge it.
/consensus/negotiate | When the miner is done, call this one again but with a payload, and then keep on retrying, SHOULD BLOCK THIS ONE.
/consensus/negotiate | When it's done, call this again for you to sleep by sending the calculated consensus, if not right then the MASTER will send a correct timer.

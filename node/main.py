Repeated Tasks
These are the tasks that needs to be executed at certain amount of time to evaluate the blockchain consensus mechanism. Sooner or later, we have to do something on this one.
TODO
- JWT Invalidation (Invalidate them if they did something or that node is inactive. This act will start when the JWT token is way past the deadline.)
- Consensus Method (Remember, that we need the consensus dependency.)

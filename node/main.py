# # API Router Setup and Initialization

Several roles prohibits the use of other functionalities that is designed for the master nodes.

* About design:
FastAPI doesn't seem to support class-based views by nature. Even when fastapi-utils provides that capability, I dont trust its functionality anymore due to the nature of FastAPI being too far than fastapi-utils can keep up.
Meaning, that tool may be outdated. Hacking it like what I did in `CodexLink/discord-activity-badge` would take
my time more than making other features, which I still haven't done.
